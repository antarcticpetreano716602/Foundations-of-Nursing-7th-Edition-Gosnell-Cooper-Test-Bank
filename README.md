Cooper and Gosnell: Foundations of Nursing, 7th Edition

MULTIPLE CHOICE

1. When a nurse becomes involved in a legal action, the first step to occur is that a document is filed in an appropriate court. What is this document called?
2. a. Deposition
3. b. Appeal
4. c. Complaint
5. d. Summons

6. ANS: C
7. A document called a complaint is filed in an appropriate court as the first step in litigation. A deposition is when witnesses are required to undergo questioning by the attorneys. An appeal is a request for a review of a decision by a higher court. A summons is a court order that notifies the defendant of the legal action.

10. 2. The nurse caring for a patient in the acute care setting assumes responsibility for a patient’s care. What is this legally binding situation?
    3. a. Nurse-patient relationship
    4. b. Accountability
    5. c. Advocacy
    6. d. Standard of care
   
    7. ANS: A
    8. When the nurse assumes responsibility for a patient’s care, the nurse-patient relationship is formed. This is a legally binding “contract” for which the nurse must take responsibility. Ac-countability is being responsible for one’s own actions. An advocate is one who defends or pleads a cause or issue on behalf of another. Standards of care define acts whose performance is required, permitted, or prohibited.

    11. 3. What are the universal guidelines that define appropriate measures for all nursing interventions?
        4. a. Scope of practice
        5. b. Advocacy
        6. c. Standard of care
        7. d. Prudent practice
       
        8. ANS: C
        9. Standards of care define actions that are permitted or prohibited in most nursing interventions. These standards are accepted as legal guidelines for appropriateness of performance. The laws that formally define and limit the scope of nursing practice are called nurse practice acts. An ad-vocate is one who defends or pleads a cause or issue on behalf of another. Prudent is a term that refers to careful and/or wise practice.

        12. 4. An LPN/LVN is asked by the RN to administer an IV chemotherapeutic agent to a patient in the acute care setting. What law should this nurse refer to before initiating this intervention?
            5. a. Standards of care
            6. b. Regulation of practice
            7. c. American Nurses’ Association Code
            8. d. Nurse practice act
           
            9. ANS: D
            10. It is the nurse’s responsibility to know the nurse practice act in his or her state. Standards of care, regulation of practice, and the American Nurses’ code are not laws that the nurse should refer to before initiating this treatment.

            13. 5. A nurse fails to irrigate a feeding tube as ordered, resulting in harm to the patient. This nurse could be found guilty of:
                6. a. malpractice.
                7. b. harm to the patient.
                8. c. negligence.
                9. d. failure to follow the nurse practice act.
               
                10. ANS: A
                11. The nurse can be held liable for malpractice for acts of omission. Failure to meet a legal duty, thus causing harm to another, is malpractice. The nurse practice act has general guidelines that can support the charge of malpractice.

                14. 6. Patients have expectations regarding the health care services they receive. To protect these expectations, which of the following has become law?
                    7. a. American Hospital Association’s Patient’s Bill of Rights
                    8. b. Self-determination act
                    9. c. American Hospital Association’s Stand-ards of Care
                    10. d. The Joint Commission’s rights and respon-sibilities of patients
                   
                    11. ANS: A
                    12. Patients have expectations regarding the health care services they receive. In 1972, the American Hospital Association (AHA) developed the Patient’s Bill of Rights. The Self-determination act, American Hospital Association’s Standards of Care, and The Joint Commission’s rights and re-sponsibilities do not address patients’ expectations regarding health care.

                    15. 7. The nurse is preparing the patient for a thoracentesis. What must be completed before the procedure may be performed?

                        12. ANS: C
                        13. The doctrine of informed consent refers to full disclosure of the facts the patient needs to make an intelligent (informed) decision before any invasive treatment or procedure is performed. A physical assessment, interview, and surgical checklist are not required before this procedure.

                        16. 8. When a nurse protects the information in a patient’s record what ethical responsibility is the nurse fulfilling?
                            9. a. Privacy
                            10. b. Disclosure

                            13. ANS: C
                            14. The nurse has an ethical and legal duty to protect information about a patient and preserve con-fidentiality. Some disclosures are legal and anticipated, and may not be subject to the rules of confidentiality. None of the information in a chart is considered secret.

                            18. 9. An older adult is admitted to the hospital with numerous bodily bruises, and the nurse suspects elder abuse. What is the best nursing action?
                                10. a. Cover the bruises with bandages.
                                11. b. Take photographs of the bruises.
                                12. c. Ask the patient if anyone has hit her.
                                13. d. Report the bruises to the charge nurse.
                               
                                14. ANS: D
                                15. The law stipulates that the health care professional is required to report certain information to the appropriate authorities. The report should be given to a supervisor or directly to the police, ac-cording to agency policy. When acting in good faith to report mandated information (e.g., certain communicable diseases or gunshot wounds), the health care professional is protected from liabil-ity.

                                    11. a. Carry malpractice insurance
                                    12. b. Spend time with the patient
                                    13. c. Provide compassionate, competent care
                                    14. d. Answer all call lights quickly
                                   
                                    15. ANS: C
                                    16. The best defense against a lawsuit is to provide compassionate and competent nursing care. Car-rying malpractice insurance is prudent, but it will not avoid a lawsuit. Spending time with pa-tients and answering call lights quickly will not necessarily help avoid a lawsuit.

                                    20. 11. The nurse is caring for a patient with a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. Although the nurse may disagree with this order, what is his or her legal obligation?
                                        12. a. To question the doctor
                                        13. b. To seek advice from the family
                                        14. c. To discuss it with the patient
                                        15. d. To follow the order
                                       
                                        16. ANS: D
                                        17. When a DNR order is written in the chart, the nurse has a duty to follow the order. Questioning the doctor, seeking advice from the family, and discussing it with the patient are not legal obliga-tions of the nurse.

                                            18. The nurse should not abandon the patient, but ask for another assignment.

A charge of malpractice is likely when a duty exists, there is a breach of that duty, and harm has occurred to the patient.

All state, provincial, and territorial legislatures in the United States and Canada have adopted nurse practice acts, although the specifics they contain often vary. It is the nurse’s re-sponsibility to know the nurse practice act that is in effect for her geographic region.
